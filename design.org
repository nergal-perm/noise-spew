  make an Engine class that keeps a collection of input generators,
  each implementing a gen(size) method that returns a buffer.
  make a UGen class that can be subclassed to make input generators.

   tail-wags-dog scenario
   foo.x(someLambda): the type system inverts? Instead of figuring out
   the type of the expression 'someLambda' and then trying to figure out
   which variant of the x() method call you meant...
   instead it'll check all the possible variants of x(),
   figure out which ones can even take lambdas, and, assuming there's
   just one method, take the type that this method invocation wishes to
   have, and then uses that to determine the type of the lambda. Very
   weird, but ingenious because it allows very succint syntax.
   Weird-ass example of this in action: I want a Runnable that I can
   serialize. How? Well, like this:
     Runnable r = (Runnable & Serializable)
                  () -> System.out.println("Weird! A cast with an ampersand?");
   The lambda is target typed to 'Runnable & Serializable' now.
   This doesn't currently work, seems borken:
   Object x = (Runnable)
               someBool ? () -> {return;} : () -> {return;}
   But that doesn't happen. According to the spec, this
   reversed typing stuff occurs ONLY for expressions in method
   invocations (the 'a' in foo(a)), and assignments (the a in Type
   varName = a; or just Type varName; varName = a;).
   Everywhere else, no target typing.
   (and, no target typing? Then no closures).
** @FunctionalInterface
   (idletask)
   any interface with n methods and n - 1 having a
   default implmenetation is a @FunctionalInterface for the nth method
* conversion / refactoring
** TODO changes to buffers in command loop, everything else in engine
*** TODO put strings -> buffers map in the command loop
*** TODO make a class for the data provided in control scope
*** TODO make a class for the data provided in the audio engine scope
*** TODO move all actions in the switch statment in loopWorker to methods
*** TODO move all actions in the switch statment in Engine.respond to methods
*** TODO eliminate the command enum and such from Engine, use the Command class
